Test Scene Setup for Drag-and-Drop: Match Coins and Notes

1. Create a new scene and save as Assets/Scenes/TestDragAndDrop.unity
2. Add an empty GameObject named 'GameManager' and attach the GameManager script.
3. Add an empty GameObject named 'UIManager' and attach the UIManager script. Set up HUD and feedback panels as needed.
4. Add an empty GameObject named 'AudioManager' and attach the AudioManager script.
5. Add an empty GameObject named 'LevelManager' and attach the LevelManager script.
6. Create a Canvas for UI. Add the HowToTutorialTemplate prefab/panel.
7. In Assets/Prefabs/DragAndDrop/, create prefabs:
   - CoinPrefab: SpriteRenderer, CanvasGroup, CoinDragHandler, CoinTypeIdentifier (set coinType)
   - SlotPrefab: SpriteRenderer, CoinSlot (set expectedCoinType)
8. Drag several CoinPrefabs and SlotPrefabs into the scene. Arrange slots and coins visually.
9. Play the scene. Drag coins to slots. Correct matches trigger feedback and scoring.
10. Use LevelManager to increase the number of coins/slots for higher levels.
